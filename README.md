# Overview

The Azure Function App Codebase Terraform module streamlines the provisioning and management of a C# .NET source codebase for Azure Functions within a designated GitHub repository. Building upon the foundational Azure Function Core module, it leverages core-provisioned resources as data sources to ensure seamless integration across multiple regional stamps. This module automates the creation and committing of essential source files, project configurations, and GitHub Actions workflows, facilitating efficient deployment, unit testing, and integration testing processes. By templating and managing these files through Terraform, the module ensures a consistent, scalable, and maintainable codebase, enabling developers to focus on building robust Azure Functions while maintaining best practices in infrastructure as code (IaC) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
